#indentation -Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
#The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.
#You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")

#variables
#variables are created when you assign a value to it:
#Python has no command for declaring a variable.
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
print(x,y)
