# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
print(1 + 2)  # Additiom
print(2 - 1)  # subtraction
print(1 * 2)  # multiplication
print(10 / 2)  # division
print(4 % 6)  # modulus
print(2 ** 2)  # exponential
print(8 // 2)  # floor divisiom

# Python Assignment Operators
x = 5
print(x)

x += 3
print(x)

x -= 3
print(x)

x *= 3
print(x)

x /= 3
print(x)

x %= 3
print(x)

# Python Comparison Operators
y = 2
x == y  # equal
x != y  # not equal
x > y  # greater than
x < y  # less than
x >= y  # Greater than or equal to
x <= y  # Less than or equal to

# Logical Operators
print(x)
print(x < 5 and x < 10)  # Returns True if both statements are true
print(x < 5 or x < 4)  # Returns True if one of the statements is true
print(not (x < 5 and x < 10))  # Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
